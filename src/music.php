        <p class="entry-text">
            Mac was huge for me during college. KIDS was playing all the time and while I don’t listen to much hip-hop these days I did find myself going through his latest record quite a few times. Wish he didn’t have to go.

        <h6 class="entry-date">July 18, 2018</h6>
        <p class="entry-text">I've been a big fan of Noah for a few years now although will admit I haven't given his latest record much attention. Ledges is a masterpiece though and should be immediately checked out if you are not familiar. Laura and I gained an even stronger affection for him after seeing him and his sister Abby at Terminal West.

            I'm relatively new to Phoebe Bridgers but have been digging her Manchester Orchestra cover lately as well. Excited to check out more her work but really am enjoying this collaboration. It's a perfect low-key week-night ballad and another one to stick the good headphones on for. The studio recording video is a delight.

        <h2 class="entry-header">No Hard Feelings - Manchester Orchestra (The Avett Brothers)</h2>
        <h6 class="entry-date">April 3, 2018</h6>
        <p class="entry-text">
            I nearly jumped off of the couch after seeing this on my Instagram feed last night. One of my favorite artists covering a band I've grown so fond of is an absolute joy. Andy's post on what this song meant to him got me learning the chords myself and scouring youtube for covers. It's very bare bones - a tribute to the powerful lyrics.  Manchester Orchestra also recently did a cover with Julien Baker that I may like even more and highly recommend giving a listen.
            <br><br>
            "Rob and I became obsessed with this @theavettbrothers song last year. It is one of the best songs that I’ve ever heard and it got to a point where I was listening to it repeatedly for several months straight. Simultaneously analyzing these layered lyrics while being emotionally floored at its weight and conclusion. I think the only way we could exercise the song’s grasp on us was to attempt a cover. We hope you enjoy."

            Brown invited me to go see this Georgia band over at The Independent a few weeks ago. They opened with this jam and I have been listening to it all the time ever since. It's the perfect show opener to get it going. I recommend Jah Werx as another good listen by Susto, but it definitely has a different feel - this band has a good bit of diversity.

        <h6 class="entry-date">November 20, 2017</h6>
        <p class="entry-text">
            My brother, Drew, showed me this knockout punch over Thanksgiving. Surrogate finds a perfect medium between garage rock and clean tones in this title track from their 2013 album. It is an instant hit from the first time it graces your ears.

        <h6 class="entry-date">November 3, 2017</h6>
        <p class="entry-text">
            I've been a fan since I saw her open for Conor Oberst. There's something profoundly cool about electric guitar solo ballads and Julien crushes it time after time. Her new record keeps pace with her first and I really got into this track. I love a bit of passionately yelling repetitive lyrics and she absolutely delivers. Check out Sprained Ankle from her first record too.
