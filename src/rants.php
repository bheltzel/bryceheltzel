        I just wrapped up the Foundation pack over at Headspace - thirty days of guided breathing meditation. Guess when I started? That’s right - September 2015. To be fair, I only did the first five days or so then, and took a light thirteen month hiatus. I even strung together a twelve day streak there at the end! I’m trying to make this a part of my daily routine. Do I feel like a changed man after these thirty days? Far from. But I can assure you I have found value in this twenty minute exercise.

        I started this challenge from personal recommendations and listening to some radio that reflected on how mediation has helped Joe Podcast Host. Most of these recommendations echoed the same sentiment - it’s going to be hard. Every day I considered a bit more why I wanted to engage in this activity. At first, it was just because I wanted to see myself unlock more productivity at work. As I reflected more on my purpose and goals, as I was encouraged to do on “the Headspace journey,” I though more about how this could help with my general patience in life and relationships, as well as my ability to just slow-down in general. Where I really saw the value though was noticing how difficult it was for me to focus on a singular activity. I struggled every day to focus on my breath or how I felt. I began to notice more and more at work how distracted I was. All. Day. I’m the guy with twenty windows open in Firefox and seventeen other applications flashing on my task bar. I get pinged or tapped on the shoulder, drop everything I was doing for that person, and not even realize I have completely gone on a separate tangent hours later.

        We live in a distracted world. I’m not the first person to notice this; you can read about it on every single tech-bloggers Medium. Yet I am going to continue to challenge myself a little bit each day to find a path towards singular-focus. This is not something that can happen overnight. My goldfish level attention span is a product of years of looking at a phone hours a day and growing up watching SpongeBob. I am going to roll back these hindrances, taking them one day, one moment at a time. I challenge you to do the same. Make an effort to see yourself with every action you take. Find awareness. Be present.
