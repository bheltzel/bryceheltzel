        I just wrapped up the Foundation pack over at Headspace - thirty days of guided breathing meditation. Guess when I started? That’s right - September 2015. To be fair, I only did the first five days or so then, and took a light thirteen month hiatus. I even strung together a twelve day streak there at the end! I’m trying to make this a part of my daily routine. Do I feel like a changed man after these thirty days? Far from. But I can assure you I have found value in this twenty minute exercise.
        <br><br>
        I started this challenge from personal recommendations and listening to some radio that reflected on how mediation has helped Joe Podcast Host. Most of these recommendations echoed the same sentiment - it’s going to be hard. Every day I considered a bit more why I wanted to engage in this activity. At first, it was just because I wanted to see myself unlock more productivity at work. As I reflected more on my purpose and goals, as I was encouraged to do on “the Headspace journey,” I though more about how this could help with my general patience in life and relationships, as well as my ability to just slow-down in general. Where I really saw the value though was noticing how difficult it was for me to focus on a singular activity. I struggled every day to focus on my breath or how I felt. I began to notice more and more at work how distracted I was. All. Day. I’m the guy with twenty windows open in Firefox and seventeen other applications flashing on my task bar. I get pinged or tapped on the shoulder, drop everything I was doing for that person, and not even realize I have completely gone on a separate tangent hours later.
        <br><br>
        We live in a distracted world. I’m not the first person to notice this; you can read about it on every single tech-bloggers Medium. Yet I am going to continue to challenge myself a little bit each day to find a path towards singular-focus. This is not something that can happen overnight. My goldfish level attention span is a product of years of looking at a phone hours a day and growing up watching SpongeBob. I am going to roll back these hindrances, taking them one day, one moment at a time. I challenge you to do the same. Make an effort to see yourself with every action you take. Find awareness. Be present.

    <h2 class="blog-header">A Question</h2>
    <h6 class="blog-date">NOVEMBER 13, 2016</h6>
    <p>
        It has been an interesting aftermath to say the least. On Wednesday, it felt like there was an elephant in the room everywhere I went. With most of the folks I follow on Twitter being in Silicon Valley, it read like the world was about to end. Thursday I made the mistake of opening Facebook and got lost in what friends and family decided to share with us. Driving home from dinner Friday night we got stuck in the midst of an anti-Trump rally making its way through the streets of Atlanta. Today, Sunday, it seems like things are starting to slow down. I felt like I had some time to digest what I had seen occur over the past few days and wanted to get some thoughts down before we all go back to our lives.
        <br><br>
        I have never considered myself politically active until this election season (as if it's short enough to call it a season). Most of the time spent reading articles or listening to the WSJ "Potomac Watch" podcast were unpleasant reminders why I didn't ever enjoy this, but I persevered. I watched most of the debates, or at least got a thorough recap in the mornings from both Fox News and then &lt;insert any other news channel&gt;. I also drank more bourbon than ever.
            <br><br>
            As someone new to the game, I liked what Bernie offered. He appeared transparent and I valued that immensely. I understand some of his ideas were radical from a traditional American political standpoint, but his character was what really got me on board. He was loyal to his values and pursuits over an extensive political career, something that I did not think Trump or Clinton could boast. When his chances began to fade out, I was disappointed in the candidates that remained. It felt disheartening to not have a dog in the fight, but I have grown accustomed to this as a lifelong Washington sports fan. I wanted to give these two a chance, so I continued to follow along.
            <br><br>
            As a millennial and living in a major metropolitan area, there was clearly a right and wrong. I didn't think it was this way in past elections. I had always had plenty of friends and family on both sides and it seemed normal for us to just disagree on things. Trump got most of the knocking around here, but was Hillary that much stronger? Her email server and her inability to give us a real explanation was a disaster. She called a quarter of the country a basket of deplorables. But between multiple moments of degrading women, a handful of racist comments without a hint of regret, and really no trace of any outlined policies on what action he would take in office, Trump takes the cake as the most unqualified candidate for president of all time. Could he turn out to be decent, or hell maybe even "Great?" Sure. I hope so. I would love if he manages to prove every person that voted against him wrong for the sake of our country, women, and minorities.
            <br><br>
            I understand that half the country (that voted) voted for this man. I understand why they did. He offered something they were looking for, right? While I may not agree with all Republican views, I highly respect the right to fight for them. So maybe they wanted to save a few points on their taxes, limit the expansion of our government, or are passionately against abortion. Maybe some change; a Washington outsider could shake things up.  Maybe these voters wanted to just simply see something they didn't see through eight years of Obama. But at the root of it all, Trump's campaign preached racism, defamation, and self-interest. So I ask, is what Trump offered more important than import than that?

        I concluded my road trip back at the end of April. I had been traveling for nearly two months without stepping foot in a home of my own. My route was DC -> Denver -> Salt Lake City -> Seattle -> Vancouver -> Whistler -> Seattle -> Portland -> San Francisco (via Route 101 and 1) -> Tahoe -> Flagstaff -> Atlanta -> Blacksburg -> DC, with many more places in between. I covered nearly 10,000 miles, 23 states, and 1 unbelievable province.
        <br><br>
        I drove from Flagstaff to Atlanta in a weekend - some might say I was in a hurry. I hit a point in San Francisco where I was ready to share the adventure again. Seeing so many pieces of what the world has to offer is a treasured privilege, but being able to share it with the person next to you is another level of euphoria.
        <br><br>
        This won't be the last time I travel alone. This won't be the last time I attempt to make a home on wheels. This experience had an important place in my life and I appreciate the overwhelming support that it received. I've had a busy summer traveling more with a person so special to me and I have reached that euphoria I mentioned many times. The next direction remains unclear, but it is a blank canvas. Next chapter.

        The cities are more stressful to car camp. Trying to decipher some parking signs with a half dozen on one post feels like it should require a bachelor's degree. I've spent hours just cruising through neighborhoods looking for an open spot at night in an free parking zone. Then once you find a spot, there is the constant worry that someone is going to tap on your window in the middle of the night to give you a ticket. Or maybe you get your car broken into. Or perhaps you are parked on 1st Avenue in downtown Seattle and someone backs into your car at 2 AM and jolts you awake. Yes, that happened.
        <br><br>
        I prefer the suburbs. The first night on the road I was so nervous about spending the night in a Walmart parking lot. I didn't sleep well and kept peeking out the window whenever I heard someone close by. Now I'm sleeping like a baby in a Walmart parking lot. Seeing those bold blue letters is like rolling into a resort. I'm right at home. There's free water, bathrooms, and cheap shit that I definitely need.
        <br><br>
        It's not the most glamorous spot to spend the night and I am certainly looking forward to some true camping along the coast, but it sure makes things simple. Thank you Walmart. You aren't so miserable after all.

        I made it to Seattle last on the 3rd, ten days ago. It has delivered the gloom that you would expect from Washington in March. The sun came out for the arrival of the rest of the crew last Saturday, but that was the extent of the sunlight I have seen here.
        <br><br>
        I stayed in Seattle for a few days, waiting out the arrival of my work laptop. Two weeks later and I still haven't been able to boot one up, an incredibly frustrating experience. I'm back in Seattle for a few more days until flying to LA on Wednesday to meet Toby and Tyler. I didn't expect to stay here the entire time, looking forward to some camping and exploring areas outside the city, but it looks like I may be locked in here again while waiting for another laptop.
        <br><br>
        Our two passenger vans and my 4Runner made the trek up to Whistler last Saturday. We stopped in Vancouver for a night. My road atlas that I purchased at Arches proved to be incredibly useful since Collin and I completely forgot our phones wouldn't work in Canada. The drive up was magnificent. There's a good stretch of coastline that looks out on mountains the tower over the Sound. It was something out of a movie.
        <br><br>
        Whistler Blackcomb was a tower itself. It stands at 7,165 ft and drops 5,020 ft. Compare that to Wisp (our family usual destination in Maryland) at 3,115 ft and a 700 ft drop and you'll start to see what I mean about how ridiculous it felt. We took a 7 mile run that lasted us over an hour on day one and I thought my legs were going to fall off. We fell into more of a groove on Tuesday and had a full day on Wednesday. Thursday a lot of the mountain was closed due to a major storm. We made a small jump right outside our house, drank too much, and made the most of it. Friday we were back out there enjoying the last of our time. The trek was unforgettable in many ways. We drove (3,500 miles for yours truly by the way), we got robbed, we crossed an international border, we skied, we drank, we relaxed, we partied, we spent time with some of our best friends and made new ones. I'm feeling thankful for the opportunity and can't wait for Gaper Week 2017.

        I have been saying for over a year I wanted to just hit the road. I have a career that allows me to work from wherever at the moment, I’m young, and I want to travel. It’s rare that these three things align so well in life. I was sitting in my room on a random weeknight, browsing Reddit, wasting time, and it hit me. What am I waiting for? I need to be in Vancouver the first week of March for a ski trip with some friends. So now I have a reason. I’m just going to go.
        <br><br>
        Even for a couple more weeks I was skeptical. I was hesitant to commit to anything. The words ‘think’ and ‘probably’ were prevalent when describing my plans. But I convinced myself I shouldn’t back out on this. It’s going to be hard. It’s a different lifestyle entirely, but I need to at least tell myself I gave it a try. If it hate it, I can be done with it. I have options. I waited until the last minute anyway to get ready. I worked on the car for only four days. Two were spent making the sleeping platform. One was spent on insulation. One was spent on packing up.
        <br><br>
        So far I really can’t complain. It’s been a transition but I expected the first few nights to be tough. What have I learned? Jason Isbell is the perfect way to travel through rural Indiana/Illinois. Serial is getting better as it goes on. People know how to drive on the highways in the Midwest. Panera is called St. Louis Bread in Missouri. You know, all valuable life lessons. All the things you expect to learn about yourself on the open road.
        <br><br>
        Home is where you park it: a trendy way of saying, I live in Wal-Mart parking lots.

        There is a good chance I'll be working remotely for the coming months as I transition back the US. I've started obsessing over the idea of how to work remotely successfully. I'm reading articles and blogs, watching TED talks, and looking into books. The idea appeals to me greatly, but I'm terrified of how it could limit my personal career growth. I am a firm believer that face time is important. With about a third of my business unit working remotely, I see examples every day of how people fade into the background. So how do you limit that from happening? There has to be a way to make your presence felt but without spending 40 hours in the office every week.
        <br><br>
        I think the quality of your work and the ability to effectively communicate should be able to replace the need to constantly be in an office setting. There is certainly value in the collaboration and camaraderie that can be gained there, but how much additional value does it truly provide? For Aon I think it does wonders for employee engagement. But on the contrary, the ability to work remotely can build engagement as well. It's a different type of engagement, but it leads to job satisfaction.
        <br><br>
        The point is, I know working remotely full time can work. It's a proven model in 2015. It's about execution and making the time to connect with your colleagues on a personal level. These are the keys to success and I need to remind myself of that nearly every day.

    <h2 class="blog-header">Planning</h2>
    <h6 class="blog-date">OCTOBER 10, 2015</h6>
    <p>
        I skimmed an article about learning to program while maintaining a day job and supporting a family. I don't even have to do half of these things! So I should be able to find the time to develop my skills outside of the workplace. Although I will admit that my day job has given me the best skills I currently have. My experience in SQL, VB.NET, and VBA is tenfold what it was before it. Every job posting values experience more than anything and after a bit over two years in the workplace it's already apparent why. There is simply no match for on the job learning. But one of the things I continue to struggle with is stepping back to plan. I find out something new and interesting and cannot restrain myself from diving head first into the code. I think you could argue that this is still a great way to develop my programming skills, but is it the most effcient? Probably not. Opening a new stackoverflow every three minutes can't be.
        <br><br>
        I want to continue to challenge myself to step back. Plan. Define and build requirements. It's not the fun part, but it has proven time and time again to be critical to success. Reading Fred Brooks' The Mythical Man-Month has given me more perspective here and only further confirms how important requirements and planning are.

    <p>
        I arrived in this new city 43 days ago. A change of pace was necessary and that is exactly what I have received. New people, new places, and new experiences surround me. The lifestyle that this place has provided me is all I could ask for. From biking to work every day to being a few steps away from my great coffee and bars, Krakow has all I need. My humble apartment sits in the Old Town, a stone's through from the city center.
        <br><br>
        I have 47 days left on my visa and am looking forward to every one of them.
